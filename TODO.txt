TODO:

1. Transform us_softball_league.tsv to match unity_golf_club.csv in columns and format.
2. Standardize first and last name columns.
3. Convert dates into a common format.
4. All states should be in two-character abbreviation.
5. Combine the two files into one master file.
6. Indicate the source file for each record in the combined file.
7. Use companies.csv to replace company_id with the company name.
8. Identify suspect records (hint: look for impossible chronological combinations).
9. Write bad records into a separate file.
10.Drop those records from the main file.
11.Build a data model to support the data seen here.
12.Write software that will write this data to a database.


Further Enhancements:

1. Explore the data in the database using SQL queries and/or visualization tools.
2. Implement a user interface to allow users to interact with the data (e.g., search, filter, sort, export).
3. Write unit tests to ensure the software works as expected and catches errors.
4. Refactor the code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
5. Add support for other database systems and file formats (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, CSV, JSON).
6. Enhance the data model to support more advanced features (e.g., user authentication, access control, auditing).
7. Expand the scope of the project to include other data sources and/or types of data (e.g., social media, web logs, sensor data).
8. Deploy the application to a cloud provider for better scalability and availability.
9. Collaborate with other developers to contribute to an open-source project or build a community


this is just a basic example, and in a real-world scenario you would need to add error handling, input validation, and other features to make the software more robust and secure.
